# TODO:
- [ ] add multi-provider inject -> create a delegator object that contains the delegators and implements the trait that delegates to each of them not using dynamic dispatch. This probably only way easily replace dynamic with static. 
- [ ] create provider for ConfigurationProperties and properties abstraction to load properties hierarchically from files using Profiles and Priority.
- [ ] add application context initializer (see spring boot macro for info)
- [ ] add ability to pass arguments to prototype bean factory
- [ ] add ability of ListableBeanContainer to fallback to prototype bean if bean does not exist, or add get_prototype_bean. Probably requires the addition of a map for type ids for prototype.
- [ ] add generics provider to add generics support for the creation of the factories and add the ability to create factories with generic parameters. For example, currently the framework maps dyn type to concrete type that implements. the desired functionality would map generic parameters that are not implemented to dyn types, and then map those dyn types to concrete types when the dyn type is reference when getting from the bean factory. Additionally, support the ability to create factories that have a dyn type parameter. This will probably require additional factory type and better indexing of type bounds.
- [ ] add the ability to create an ordering to be implemented for each of the providers, and have this ordering be a consumer of all previous orderings and output a new ordering. For example, create a provider that accepts the ID's of a provider type, and has the ability to change the orderings of the providers.
- [ ] split out the creation of the factories into a provider like the aspect
- [ ] update the activation of git so that it doesn't recompile all files every time and potentially add cache.
