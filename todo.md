# TODO:
- [ ] update the build-lib so that it loads from a codegen_factory like authentication_gen does for the case of aspects. In this case, the aspect library parses the program finding where the aspects are to be. Then, this imported code contains program information introspected. In this case, the build-lib is then imported where enable_aop annotation is added to a module potentially containing aspects. The build-lib imported code then contains whether one of the structs or functions within this module annotated is decorated, and furthermore it contains all of code to do the decoration. So then this simply means that anything needing access to the entire program and also needing to modify in-line (such as aspects or authentication_gen) needs to be a codegen precompile whereby the provider imports in it's build.rs that precompile code and then saves code to a codegen-{id}.rs file to be imported for that attribute macro providing a mutable scope to make the change.
- [ ] update to dynamic linking potentially by adding to the [links] section for the dynamically built libraries that are referencing code in target folder?
- [ ] add multi-provider inject -> create a delegator object that contains the delegators and implements the trait that delegates to each of them not using dynamic dispatch. This probably only way easily replace dynamic with static. 
- [ ] create provider for ConfigurationProperties and properties abstraction to load properties hierarchically from files using Profiles and Priority.
- [ ] add application context initializer (see spring boot macro for info)
- [ ] add ability to pass arguments to prototype bean factory
- [ ] add ability of ListableBeanContainer to fallback to prototype bean if bean does not exist, or add get_prototype_bean. Probably requires the addition of a map for type ids for prototype.
- [ ] split out the creation of the factories into a provider like the aspect
- [ ] update the activation of git so that it doesn't recompile all files every time and potentially add cache.
